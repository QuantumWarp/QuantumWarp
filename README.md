# Welcome to my GitHub ðŸ‘‹

Please take a look at some of the projects I've worked on! My personal favourites are the top 2 listed, but there are many more below, spanning many years and many languages. I've always got a few things on the go, and have a number of finished projects that are live that I am hosting. If you have any questions about anything, please feel free to drop me an email and I would be more than happy to reply!

One of my favourite sites I have made. Using various tools, you can zoom into different fractals, adjusting the colours to your liking, saving any of the interesting patterns you discover. The maths behind generating these is surprisingly simple, especially considering the complexity of the fractals it produces.

## Tabletop Assistant

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/mongodb/mongodb-original.svg" />

A online tool that can be used to replace paper for any Tabletop RPG. The current live version has all the basics I needed to start using it myself. This is one of the projects I want to keep going with to make it suitable and appealing to a wider audience. Currently adding dynamically changing values, Microsoft Sign In and a simple way to import configurations from templates.

## Text Adventure

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/typescript/typescript-original.svg" />

A very recent project I started, inspired by a friend starting to learn a bit about software development. I found that it seemed like a fun project that would actually be limited in scope for once. However there has still been a lot of interesting problems with both the project structure and with programmatically using the terminal in VS Code and with xterm.js in the browser.

## Card Game

__In Development -

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/csharp/csharp-original.svg" />

This project I keep returning to over the years. The core engine of the card game is made to handle potential complex interactions between cards and other events. The long term aim is to make a game easy enough to pick up, like Slay the Spire, but with a few more complex interactions and things to plan out, more akin to MTG, with a really flexible way to add varied and interesting effects.

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/vuejs/vuejs-original.svg" />

A site to create simple patterns that can be used for knitting. A somewhat bespoke app, since it was made to provide a single person with a more convenient place to track their knitting progress and patterns.

## Portfolio

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/vuejs/vuejs-original.svg" />

A simple portfolio site I used as a way to get in some Vue practice before a job where it was required. It is mostly kept up to date, but often needs another pass from time to time.

## Simple File Tagger

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/react/react-original.svg" />

An application to apply tags to files to organise documents or pictures within a flat file structure. Was good to get my initial React practice and skill up in Electron. I use it sometimes myself for my own files, but could do with some work and clean up. Use at your own risk!

## Maze Generator

A simple generator which was made to create some connected mazes for a potential game.

<img height=20 src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/sqlite/sqlite-original.svg" />

An early project, one of the first I created with authentication. I initially made it to organise my collection of MTG cards, but archived the project due to some issues with it's performance and also finding some more complete solutions out there that suited my needs.
